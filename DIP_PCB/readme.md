# BOM

1 x Atmel/Microchip AVR ATMega88 in 28 pin DIP package.  Any speed grade will do.

(Optional) 1 x 28 pin DIP socket.  If you ommit this part the the resistor will need to be soldered
  to the reverse side of the PCB, taking care to leave as little amount of leg protruding underneath
  as possible.

1 x 330 Ohm resistor

1 x LED (any regualr LED will do)

1 x 100nF ceramic capacitor

1 x 100uF electrolytic capacitor

1 x 3-by-2 pin header.  Optional if you are going to program the AVR out of circuit.

1 x SNES control port socket.  Straight pin or right angled by your preference.  The PCB is able to accomodate
  the sockets that use the thicker pins.

2 x Female DB9 plug/socket with straight PCB mounts.  When soldering I recommend spacing them out from the PCB
  a couple of mm.
